# Brunch + Babel/ES6

This is a modern JS skeleton for [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Getting started

* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`
* Run:
    * `npm start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `npm run build` — builds minified project for production
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
    * [Brunch site](http://brunch.io), [Getting started guide](https://github.com/brunch/brunch-guide#readme)
    * Handlebars Static site templating structure is written in app/layouts, app/partials, and app/pages, and output to public by handlebars and html-brunch-static.
    * html-brunch-static enables handlebars precompiled templates.

## ES-next

To use proposed JS features not included into ES6, do this:

* `npm install --save-dev babel-preset-stage-0`
* in `brunch-config.js`, add the preset: `presets: ['latest', 'stage-0']`
